# MUFON DATA

This was found on Kaggle - see [`datapackage.info.json`](./datapackage.info.json).

I have cleaned it up a little, but there are still many issues with the data, such as missing locations, incorrectly entered data.

But it is a first step.

Next step: extract shapes into a related table or ENUM, or at least ensure consistent spellings.

Also, the script drops a couple of columns that are meant to be duplicates in a different format: should check that is so.
